# CHAPTER TEN

## The Summit

The drive from Portland to the cabin took seven hours.

Elena sat in the passenger seat, silent, watching the highway unspool through grey February rain.

"He's not going to let you walk in," Elena said. "He'll have contingencies."

"I know." Sarah gripped the wheel. "He's part of a network. He knows I'll do whatever it takes to protect Lily."

---

The cabin sat at the end of a dirt road, half-hidden by pines. Sarah parked a mile out, walked the rest of the way.

James Morrison stood in the threshold, a shotgun held loosely at his side.

"Sarah." He smiled. "I wasn't sure you'd come alone."

"I wasn't sure I would either."

"Search her."

A second man stepped out of the shadows. He patted Sarah down, found the wire, the tracker.

"Come in."

---

The inside of the cabin was sparse. Lily wasn't visible. Sarah's heart clenched.

"Lily—"

"Upstairs. She's fine." He set the shotgun on the counter. "She's been instructive. Your daughter. She sees things."

Sarah sat. "You said you wanted a choice. What choice?"

"The same choice you made fifteen years ago." He sat across from her. "Back then, you had information. You heard something in my voice—you knew. But you chose not to act."

"I didn't know. Not for certain."

"You knew." His voice didn't rise. "You felt it. And you told yourself it was nothing."

Sarah said nothing.

"Now you have another choice." James leaned forward. "The network—I'm assuming you found it. Let me walk away. Let the network continue. And Lily goes free."

"That's not a choice. That's a trap."

"It's the same choice you made before."

Sarah stood. "I want to see her."

"In a minute." He turned. "First, we finish this. Fifteen years of unfinished business."

"There's no business here. Just pain you won't let go of."

"Pain is spending twelve years becoming the monster everyone thought you were, just so you can finally get the one person who created you to admit what she did."

Sarah didn't move. "And what did I do?"

"You knew." His voice cracked. "You knew who I was. In the Harrison case. You heard my voice, and you recognized something. And you chose to ignore it."

"You're right," she said quietly. "You're right. I heard it. The hesitation in your voice. I knew—I felt—that something was wrong. And I chose not to follow it."

She looked at him. Directly.

"I was wrong. I was afraid. And you paid the price."

"That's not enough."

"It's all I have."

He reached for the shotgun.

The sound came from upstairs.

A crash. Glass breaking. Then Lily's voice, shouting: "NOW!"

The door behind Sarah exploded inward. Agents poured through. James spun, raised the shotgun—

But Lily was already there.

She came down the stairs at a run, something glittering in her hand. She drove the shard into James's forearm, and the weapon clattered to the floor.

James stumbled. Lily didn't wait. She tackled him, brought him down, pressed the glass to his throat.

"Don't move," she hissed. "Don't you dare move."

The agents surrounded them.

Sarah was looking at her daughter.

Lily's face was scratched, her shirt torn, her hands shaking. But her eyes were clear. Focused.

"You came," Lily whispered.

"I came."

"I knew you would."

---

The next hours were chaos. Sarah sat on the porch of the cabin, wrapped in a thermal blanket, watching the sun rise over the mountains.

Her phone buzzed. David.

"Elena's safe," he said. "She's given a full statement. Marcus is in custody."

"And the network?"

"Collapsing. It's over, Sarah."

She looked at the cabin. Somewhere inside, James was being questioned.

"Is Lily okay?"

"She's asking for you."

"I need a minute."

She hung up. Sat there as the sun climbed higher.

A car pulled up. Agent Reyes got out, walked toward her.

"We found something," he said. "In the basement. Evidence of the network."

Sarah nodded. "She's a fast learner."

Reyes hesitated. "We also found something else. A recording. The original Harrison case. The call you took."

He held up an evidence bag. Inside, an old cassette tape.

"He kept it," Sarah said. "All these years."

She took the bag. Looked at the tape inside.

Fifteen years of evidence. Fifteen years of guilt.

She thought about Lily. About the look in her daughter's eyes when she'd pinned James to the floor.

Sarah stood. Walked to the trash can by the porch.

She dropped the tape in.

Reyes stared. "You're not going to—"

"I don't need it anymore." She brushed off her hands. "I know what the hesitation sounds like. I've always known."

She walked back toward the car, toward her daughter, toward the future.

The past was gone.

The only thing that mattered was what came next.
