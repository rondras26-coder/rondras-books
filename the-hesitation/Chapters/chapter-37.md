# CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN

## A New Beginning

---

One year later.

Sarah sat on the porch of her new house in Vermont. The autumn wind blew through the colorful leaves, scattering them across the lawn like fragments of a forgotten past.

The house was small but comfortable—a cottage, really, tucked away in the woods where nobody would think to look. She had bought it with the proceeds from her book, the memoir she had written about her experiences. It wasn't much, but it was hers.

And for the first time in years, she was alone. Not lonely—alone. There was a difference.

Lily came to visit. She had finished her medical degree, graduated at the top of her class, and now worked as a doctor in Boston. She was busy, successful, happy. Everything Sarah had hoped for.

"Mom." Lily sat down beside her on the porch. "How does it feel to be retired?"

Sarah laughed. "Strange. Different. Good."

"And the truth? About the Architects?"

"It's out. Everyone knows it." Sarah looked at her daughter. The light from the setting sun caught her face, highlighting the similarities and differences between them. "Some things can't be undone. But they can be set right. And now the next generation can build on what we've done."

Lily nodded. "And now what?"

"Now?" Sarah stood up, stretching her muscles. The autumn air was crisp, clean, invigorating. "Now I live my life. For the first time in fifteen years. I read books, I take walks, I watch the leaves change. I do whatever I want, whenever I want."

"That sounds amazing."

"It is." Sarah smiled. "You should try it sometime."

"I will." Lily stood, wrapping her arms around her mother. "But for now, I have to get back. Work waits for no one."

"I know." Sarah hugged her back. "Go. Be great. That's what you do."

Lily drove away, her car disappearing down the long driveway, leaving Sarah alone with her thoughts.

She sat back down on the porch, watching the sun dip below the horizon. The sky was painted in shades of orange and purple, the colors of sunset, the colors of endings and beginnings.

The past year had been difficult. The investigation, the trial, the constant pressure of exposing the Architects—it had taken a toll on her physically and emotionally. But it had also been rewarding. She had seen the truth prevail. She had watched the corrupt fall. She had helped make the world a little bit better.

And now, she was free.

Life went on. The truth had come to light.

And the future—the future belonged to them.
