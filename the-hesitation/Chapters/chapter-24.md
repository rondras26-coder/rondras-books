# CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

## The Confession

---

The cabin was filled with agents. James was being treated by paramedics. Lily was in David's arms, finally safe.

But Sarah wasn't done.

She walked over to James, who sat on the porch, staring at nothing.

"James."

"Don't." His voice was hollow. "Don't talk to me."

"I have to." Sarah sat beside him. "Fifteen years ago. The Harrison case. I heard something."

James looked at her.

"In the killer's voice. A hesitation. A pattern." Sarah took a breath. "I knew. I felt it. But I was young. I was hungry. I chose protocol over instinct."

"You—"

"I betrayed you. By not trusting myself, I let a monster go free. And then Marcus used that to destroy you."

James was silent for a long moment.

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because you deserve the truth. Because Lily deserves a mother who doesn't lie. Because—" Sarah's voice broke. "Because I've been punishing myself for fifteen years, and I'm done."

James looked at her. And for the first time, she saw something in his eyes. Not anger. Not hatred.

Understanding.

"I heard it too," he said quietly. "In your voice. When you were negotiating. I heard the hesitation."

"That's what made you good."

"That's what made me broken." He looked away. "But maybe... maybe we can both heal."

Sarah nodded. "Maybe."
