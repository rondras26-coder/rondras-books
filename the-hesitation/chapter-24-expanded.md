# CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

## The Trial

---

The courtroom was silent as Marcus Webb was led to his seat.

Six weeks. That's how long the trial had lasted. Six weeks of testimony, evidence, emotional testimony from victims and witnesses alike. Six weeks of watching Marcus sit stoically, his face a mask of indifference, as the world he had built came crashing down around him.

Sarah testified. So did Elena. So did James, from a wheelchair, his words barely above a whisper. The jury listened, their faces growing harder with each revelation—the scope of Marcus's crimes, the depth of his manipulations, the sheer breadth of the network he had controlled.

The evidence was overwhelming. The network fell. Justice was served.

But for Sarah, the hardest moment came on the last day, when she had to listen to the Harrison case recordings one final time.

The killer's voice. The hesitation. The pattern she had ignored fifteen years ago.

She listened to it one more time, in the quiet of her hotel room, the headphones clamped over her ears. And this time—this time she heard something different.

It wasn't just a hesitation. It was a plea. A desperate, unspoken cry for help from a man who had been pushed too far, broken too completely, left with no other options.

The pattern wasn't evidence. It was a cry for mercy.

She listened to it one more time.

And then she deleted it.

Not because it didn't matter. But because it mattered too much. Because holding onto it meant holding onto the past, onto the guilt, onto the weight of what she had done and failed to do.

Letting it go meant moving forward. It meant accepting that she couldn't change what had happened—only what would happen next.

The verdict came on a Tuesday.

Guilty. On all counts.

Marcus showed no reaction as the words were spoken. His face remained calm, his posture unchanged. It was as though he had expected this all along, as though he had already made peace with his fate.

But Sarah saw something in his eyes as he was led away—a flicker of something. Fear? Anger? Regret? She couldn't tell. Maybe he couldn't either.

She stood at the back of the courtroom, watching him being led past. Their eyes met for just a moment. And in that moment, Sarah felt something she hadn't expected: pity.

Marcus Webb had spent his entire life building a network, manipulating people, destroying lives—all to fill a void inside himself. He had never been loved. He had never been understood. He had never allowed himself to be vulnerable, to need anyone, to feel anything other than control.

And in the end, all his power, all his influence, all his carefully constructed schemes—it had meant nothing. He was alone. He would die alone. And he would take all his secrets with him.

That was the tragedy, Sarah realized. Not that Marcus had been caught, but that he had never allowed himself to be anything other than what he was. He had built walls so high, so strong, that even he couldn't climb over them.

Outside the courthouse, the media was waiting.

Reporters shouted questions, cameras flashed, microphones were thrust toward her face. But Sarah pushed through them all, her eyes fixed on the car waiting at the curb.

David was there, holding the door open. Lily was in the back seat, smiling, safe.

"Where to?" David asked as he slid into the driver's seat.

"Home," Sarah said. "Just... home."

They drove through the city in silence, the weight of the day pressing down on all of them. It wasn't an unhappy silence—it was the kind of silence that came from exhaustion, from relief, from the simple comfort of being together.

When they reached the house, Sarah didn't get out immediately. She sat in the car, staring at the familiar façade, the windows glowing with warm light.

"Mom?" Lily's voice was gentle. "You okay?"

"I don't know," Sarah admitted. "I thought I would feel different. After the verdict. After... everything."

"How do you feel?"

Sarah considered the question. "Empty," she said finally. "Like I've been holding my breath for fifteen years, and now I can finally exhale. But it's strange. I don't know what to do with all this... space."

"You could start by coming inside," David said. "I made dinner. Nothing fancy, just pasta. But it's hot, and it's ready."

Sarah laughed. It felt strange on her face—unfamiliar, like a muscle she hadn't used in years. "You made dinner?"

"I learned." He shrugged. "When you spend as much time alone as I have, you pick up a few skills."

They got out of the car, walking toward the house together. Lily was in the middle, her arms wrapped around both their shoulders, a barrier between the world and her family.

Inside, the house was warm. The table was set, candles flickering, the smell of garlic and tomatoes filling the air. It looked like a normal family dinner. It looked like a life Sarah had almost forgotten was possible.

They sat down, and for the first time in fifteen years, Sarah felt something she couldn't name. It wasn't happiness—not quite. It wasn't peace—not yet.

But it was a start.
