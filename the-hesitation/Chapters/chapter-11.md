# CHAPTER ELEVEN

## The Network

The fallout from Daniel's arrest was immediate.

The FBI found evidence of connections—not just to James, but to a larger network. Former HRT operatives. CIA contractors. People scattered across governments.

And at the center: Victor Strand.

"Former CIA psychologist," Reyes said. "Black sites, interrogation programs. He's been building this for thirty years."

Sarah felt the weight settle. "I created this. Me → James → Daniel → the network."

---

The call came that night.

Unknown number. Overseas.

"Dr. Chen." A male voice. Calm. Measured. "My name is Victor Strand. I believe it's time we met."

"How did you get this number?"

"I have many numbers." She could hear the smile. "I'm holding a conference next month. In Geneva. Come and see what I've built."

The line went dead.

---

The Geneva summit was seven days away.

Sarah spent them in the FBI command center, reviewing Strand's history. He was a ghost—vanished after the Cold War, reappeared in private consulting.

But ghosts left footprints.

"His network is everywhere," Reyes said, pulling up a map. "Governments. Corporations. Media."

---

The Palexpo conference center was massive.

Sarah moved through the crowd—world leaders, corporate CEOs, media moguls.

Her phone buzzed. Text from an unknown number:

*Room 412. Come alone.*

She went.

---

The room was small. A table, two chairs, a window overlooking the city.

Strand was waiting. White hair, sharp eyes. The face of a predator.

"Dr. Chen." He smiled. "I was wondering when you'd come."

"How did you find me?"

"I find everyone." He gestured to the chair. "Sit."

She sat.

"What's the real target?"

"Perspective. I'm showing them what's possible. What the world could become if we stopped pretending."

He leaned forward.

"We don't have free will, Dr. Chen. We're all just patterns. Respond to stimuli. React to pressures."

"And you want to control them."

"I want to optimize. No more wars. No more corruption. Just order."

"That's not order. That's control."

The door opened.

Lily stood in the doorway.

"Lily!" Sarah was on her feet. "What are you doing here?"

"I followed you." Lily stepped into the room. "I had to know."

Strand smiled. "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."

"Get away from her." Sarah moved toward Lily.

"I wouldn't." Strand held up a small device. "The building is wired."

Lily moved.

She tackled Strand, knocked the device from his hand, pinned him to the floor.

Sarah grabbed the device.

"It's over," she said.

Strand laughed.

"You think this is over?" He smiled up at her. "I'm not the leader. There's someone else. Someone higher."

The ground shook.

An explosion, somewhere in the building.

Alarms blared.

"Go," Lily said. "Help them. I'll hold him."

Sarah ran.

---

The chaos was absolute.

Smoke, fire, screaming. People trampled each other trying to escape.

Sarah pushed through the crowd.

Her phone buzzed. Text from Reyes:

*Bombs in three locations. He's not the leader—there's someone else.*

The network. The web. The puppet master behind the puppet master.

Sarah stood in the middle of the collapsing building.

The hunt wasn't over.

It was just beginning.

---

The fallout from Geneva was catastrophic.

Forty-seven dead. Hundreds injured. Markets crashed.

And Victor Strand was dead—shot during the evacuation, his body lost in the rubble.

But Sarah knew better.

"He's not dead," she said, standing in the FBI command center three days later. "But I know who's above him."

She pulled up a file. A name she hadn't seen in twenty years.

*Catherine Wells.*

Reyes looked at her. "What?"

"It can't be."

Catherine Wells had been her student. Twenty years ago. Brilliant. The best she'd ever trained.

She'd disappeared. Killed in a car bomb in Karachi, fifteen years ago.

A cover.

"Find her," Sarah said.

---

The lead came from James.

"I know who you're looking for," he said, in his prison cell. "Catherine."

"Tell me."

"She was the one who found me after I was expelled. She told me about Strand. About the network." His voice was flat. "She was the brain. Strand was just the face."

The call came that night.

"Hello, Sarah." A woman's voice. Calm. Familiar. "It's been a long time."

"Catherine."

"Twenty years. You look good."

"You look different."

Catherine laughed. "The face is new. The body is new. But I'm still the same. Still your student."

"What do you want?"

"What I've always wanted. To understand. To see what you see."

"You're insane."

"I'm awake." Catherine's voice hardened. "The network is everywhere. In governments, corporations. They're waiting for the right moment."

"What moment?"

"The collapse. The chaos. When the world needs someone to rebuild it."

---

The package arrived the next morning.

A plane ticket. A key. A note.

*The key is to the past. The plane is to the future. Come to Budapest.*

Sarah went.

---

The old intelligence headquarters was a brutalist building on the Danube.

The key opened a side door. Sarah walked down corridors that smelled like dust and secrets.

She found Catherine in a room full of screens. Data streams. Connections. The world, laid bare.

"You came," Catherine said.

"I had to."

"You had a choice. You chose to come."

"Because I need to understand."

Catherine smiled. "That's what I've always wanted. To be understood."

She gestured to the screens.

"This is the world. Every decision, every transaction. I've been watching for twenty years."

"You're controlling it."

"I'm understanding it." Catherine turned to Sarah. "You taught me that. The hesitation. The pattern. The moment when someone's true self shows through."

"I taught you to save lives."

"I teach people to see the truth." Catherine stepped closer. "Join me. Help me optimize."

"Or?"

"Or watch everything burn."

The door behind Sarah opened. Two guards entered.

Catherine smiled.

"Now," she said, "we have a choice to make."

Sarah's phone buzzed. A text from David:

*Safe house in Austria. Lily's safe. I'm coming for you.*

She looked at Catherine.

"I'll make my choice," she said.

Then she ran.

---

The SUV was idling in the alley.

David was behind the wheel.

"Drive!" Sarah shouted.

He did.

The safe house was in the Hungarian countryside.

Sarah sat at the kitchen table, hands shaking, as David made coffee.

"You found her," he said.

"Catherine. My student. Twenty years ago."

"How did this happen?"

"I trained her. Just like James. Just like Daniel." Sarah's voice cracked. "I gave them the tools. They built something I never imagined."

"What do you do now?"

"I don't know." She looked at him. "But I know who might help."

"Who?"

"Lily."
