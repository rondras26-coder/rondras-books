# CHAPTER FOURTEEN

## The Price of Victory

*Extended Version*

---

The trial lasted six months.

Daniel Price refused to testify. Refused to explain. Refused to do anything but smile.

The jury convicted him on all counts. Terrorism. Kidnapping. Conspiracy. Murder.

He would spend the rest of his life in a maximum security prison.

But Sarah knew it wasn't over.

"The network is still out there," she told Reyes. "Daniel was just one node. There are others."

"We've dismantled the structure. The cells are in disarray."

"For now. They'll reorganize. They always do."

"What do you suggest?"

Sarah looked at the map. At the world. At the patterns.

"We need to understand them," she said. "Not just fight them."

The next year was spent in research.

Sarah interviewed former network members. She studied the psychology. She developed new techniques.

And slowly, she began to understand.

The pattern wasn't just about manipulation. It was about control. The network wasn't just a criminal organization—it was a philosophy. A belief that humans needed to be controlled.

"We're not fighting a group," she told her students. "We're fighting an idea. And ideas can't be killed."

"Then how do we win?"

"We don't win. We change the conversation. We teach people to see the pattern for themselves."
