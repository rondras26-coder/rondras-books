# CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE

## The Investigation

---

The next three months, Sarah spent verifying James' information.

It was painstaking work. Going through files. Interviewing witnesses. Gathering evidence. She worked with contacts she had built up over decades—journalists, investigators, fellow agents who trusted her. She cross-referenced names, dates, locations. She looked for patterns, for connections, for anything that might explain what James had been trying to tell her.

And slowly, piece by piece, she found something.

A network of corrupt officials, judges, politicians. All connected by a common secret. All part of a larger organization that operated in the shadows, making decisions that affected millions of lives.

They called themselves the "Architects."

Sarah had dedicated her life to hunting the truth. But this was different. This wasn't about catching a criminal or solving a case. This was about exposing a system—a system that had been operating for decades, that had corrupted every institution it touched, that seemed impossible to stop.

She called David.

"I need your help," she said.

"What kind of help?"

"Information. You have contacts. People who trust you."

A long pause. "Sarah, what are you doing?"

"What's right." She looked out the window at the grey city. "What I should have done fifteen years ago."

David sighed. "Where do we start?"

The investigation took months.

Sarah and David worked together, pooling their resources, sharing their findings. They met in secret locations—parking garages, abandoned buildings, coffee shops where they could talk without being overheard. They used encrypted phones, coded messages, every precaution they could think of.

Because they both knew: the Architects were watching. They had eyes everywhere. And if they found out what Sarah was doing...

But she couldn't stop. Not now. Not when she was so close.

The first major breakthrough came in the form of a name: Senator Howard Vance.

He had been a rising star in the party—a champion of law and order, a man who had built his career on being tough on crime. But according to the files Sarah had uncovered, he had been meeting with Marcus Webb for years—passing information, making deals, protecting the network.

"He'll be hard to touch," David said when she showed him the evidence. "He's got too many allies, too much power."

"Everyone's untouchable until they're not." Sarah printed out the files, stacking them carefully. "I'm going to find someone who can help."

"Who?"

"Someone who knows the inside. Someone who has nothing left to lose."

Elena Morrison agreed to meet her in a coffee shop in Oakland.

She looked healthier than the last time Sarah had seen her—color in her cheeks, light in her eyes. The art was helping, she said. The therapy was helping. But there was still a long way to go.

"I thought you'd be in hiding," Sarah said.

"I was. For a while." Elena stirred her coffee, watching the swirls of cream dissolve. "But I decided that running wasn't living. I wanted to actually live, for once."

"That's brave."

"That's necessary." Elena looked up. "You said you needed my help."

"I need to know about the Architects. The network. Everything Marcus didn't tell me."

Elena was quiet for a long moment. "It's bigger than you think. Deeper. The Architects—they're not just criminals. They're ideologues. They believe they're saving the world."

"Saving it from what?"

"From itself." Elena's voice was bitter. "They think the system is broken beyond repair. They think the only way to fix it is from outside—through manipulation, through control, through making the hard choices that elected officials are too weak to make."

"That's insane."

"Maybe. But they have resources, connections, patience. They think in decades, not election cycles. They're playing a long game, Sarah. And they've been winning."

Sarah leaned forward. "How do I stop them?"

Elena met her eyes. "You find someone on the inside. Someone who can give you evidence. Someone who can testify."

"Who?"

"I don't know." Elena stood, leaving cash on the table for the coffee. "But if anyone can find them, it's you. Be careful, Sarah. These people—they don't forgive traitors. And they don't forget."
