# CHAPTER FIVE: THE ESCAPE

*Expanded Version*

---

One year after Geneva.

The prison was in Arizona—a maximum security facility, surrounded by desert, designed to hold the worst of the worst. Daniel Price had been there for eight months, serving a life sentence without parole.

Sarah had been to see him twice. Both times, he'd refused to speak. Both times, she'd left with nothing.

But she kept coming back. Because she had to. Because there were answers she needed.

"The network," she said, on the third visit. "Tell me about the network."

Daniel smiled. He was older now—grey hair, lines on his face—but his eyes were the same. Sharp. Focused. Unreadable.

"You know about the network," he said. "You stopped it."

"I stopped one operation. One cell. There are others."

"There are always others. That's the point."

Sarah leaned forward. "Who else is out there? Who's running things now?"

"You know I can't tell you that."

"You can. You won't."

"Semantics." He stood, walked to the window. "Here's the truth, Sarah. The network isn't an organization. It's an idea. You can't destroy an idea."

"You can stop the people who act on it."

"For a while. Until new people rise up. Until new Directors take control."

"So what's the answer? Give up? Let them win?"

Daniel turned. His eyes were calm.

"The answer is the same thing you've been teaching. Trust your instincts. See the hesitation. Find the truth."

"That's what I'm trying to do."

"Then try harder." He smiled. "That's what I did."

The call came three days later.

Sarah was at home, in her Virginia house, reviewing files. The phone rang—a number she didn't recognize.

"Dr. Chen." The voice was male. Familiar. "We need to talk."

"Who is this?"

"You know who I am."

And she did. The pattern. The hesitation. The voice she'd been trained to recognize.

"Daniel," she said. "You're in prison."

"Temporarily." A pause. "There's been a development."

"What kind of development?"

"The kind that requires your attention. The kind that changes everything."

"I'm listening."

"Not on the phone. Meet me. Tonight. The old warehouse on the waterfront."

"That's not—"

"Or don't. But then you'll never know the truth."

The line went dead.

---

The warehouse was abandoned, decrepit, the kind of place that appeared in nightmares. Sarah parked a block away, walked the rest on foot. Her heart was pounding, but her hands were steady.

She'd done this a hundred times. She could do it again.

Inside, Daniel was waiting. He was in prison clothes—orange jumpsuit, shackles on his wrists—but he didn't look like a prisoner. He looked like a man in control.

"You came," he said.

"Tell me what's going on."

"The network is bigger than you know. Deeper. More connected." He paused. "There's a second Director. A higher level."

"What do you mean?"

"The first Director—who trained me—was just a student. A copy. The real Director is someone else. Someone who's been there since the beginning."

Sarah stared at him. "Who?"

"I don't know. That's the truth. I've never met them. But I know they exist."

"How?"

"The patterns. The communications. The way operations are coordinated. It's too sophisticated for one person. Too organized."

"So there's a structure. A hierarchy."

"A pyramid. The Director at the top. The cells below. And more cells below that."

Sarah's mind raced. "Why are you telling me this?"

"Because I'm tired." Daniel's voice cracked. "Because I've spent my life running, and I'm done. Because I want to end this."

"End what?"

"The network. The pattern. The whole thing."

"Why now?"

"Because they killed James. And they've killed others. And they'll keep killing until someone stops them."

Sarah was quiet for a long moment.

"What do you want from me?"

"Help me bring them down. Help me expose the truth."

"And in exchange?"

"In exchange, I give you everything. Names. Locations. Operations. Everything I know."

Sarah thought about James. About Lily. About all the years of chasing shadows.

"Okay," she said. "Let's talk."

---

The debrief took three days.

Daniel talked. And talked. And talked.

He gave up names, locations, operations. He explained the structure of the network, the communications protocols, the ways they evaded detection.

And he gave up one more thing: the identity of the second Director.

"Catherine Wells," he said. "She's the one. The real one. She's been running things from the beginning."

Sarah had heard that name before. In the files. In the reports.

"She's a ghost," Daniel continued. "No one knows where she is. No one knows what she looks like. But she's the one."

"How do I find her?"

"That's the problem. You can't. Not directly."

"Then how?"

Daniel smiled. "You have to let her find you."
