# FINAL CHAPTER

## The Circle Continues

*Extended Version*

---

Fifty years after Sarah's death.

The Chen Institute was now the largest emotional intelligence training center in the world.

Students from every country. Research in every field. The techniques had saved countless lives.

And the lesson—the simple, profound lesson—had spread everywhere.

Maria was seventy years old. She was the dean now.

One day, a young woman approached her.

"Dr. Maria. Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"How did Sarah do it? How did she keep going, even when everything was against her?"

Maria thought for a moment.

"She believed in the lesson," she said. "She believed that people could change. That the hesitation was a gift, not a curse."

"But wasn't she scared? Didn't she want to give up?"

"Of course she was scared. Of course she wanted to give up." Maria smiled. "That's what made her human. That's what made her brave."

"What do you mean?"

"Bravery isn't the absence of fear. It's the choice to act despite fear. Sarah understood that."

The young woman nodded slowly.

"I think I understand."

"Good." Maria put a hand on her shoulder. "Now go teach someone else."
