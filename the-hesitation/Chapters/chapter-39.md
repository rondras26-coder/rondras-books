# CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE

## Montreal

---

Snow fell on Montreal as Sarah stepped off the train.

The city was beautiful – old, European, full of history. The cobblestone streets, the historic buildings, the feeling of a place that had seen centuries of human drama. But she had no time for sightseeing.

The library was an old building from the 19th century. Stone walls, tall windows, a feeling of knowledge and power. It had been a gathering place for intellectuals, revolutionaries, thinkers of all kinds. Now it was a museum, open to the public but largely ignored.

James waited for her in the lobby.

"You came," he said.

"I couldn't help it." She looked at him. He looked older—but his eyes, his eyes were still the same. Haunted, brilliant, lost. "What happened?"

He led her inside, through the marble halls, past the reading rooms and archives. "I'll show you everything."

In the library's basement, hidden behind a false wall, were documents. Hundreds. Thousands.

"This is just a part," James explained. "There's more. All over the world. The Architects weren't just American. They were global. A network of like-minded people in every country, every government, every institution."

Sarah flipped through the pages. Names, dates, operations. A network that spanned continents, that touched every corner of the globe. It was staggering. Overwhelming.

"How long?" she whispered. "How long has this been going on?"

"Decades. Maybe longer." He shook his head. "They started after World War II—people who saw the horrors of war and decided that the only way to prevent future catastrophes was to take control. They've been operating in secret ever since."

"And we're supposed to stop them?"

"We're the only ones who can." James met her eyes. "You and me, Sarah. Together. It's always been us—the teacher and the student, the hunter and the hunted. We've been circling each other for twenty years. Maybe it's time we actually worked together."

Sarah looked at the documents spread across the table. The weight of the truth pressed down on her. This was bigger than anything she had ever faced. Bigger than Marcus, bigger than the Architects, bigger than all of it.

But she had faced big things before. And she had never backed down.

"Where do we start?"
