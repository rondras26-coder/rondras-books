# CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

## The Training Center

*Extended Version*

---

The training center was in the mountains of Virginia.

Sarah had built it with her own money—every dollar from her books, her speeches, her retirement. It was a place where students could learn without distraction. Where they could focus on the pattern.

The curriculum was simple but intense.

Week One: Recognition. Learning to see the hesitation in others.

Week Two: Application. Learning to use the pattern.

Week Three: Mastery. Learning to trust yourself.

Week Four: Integration. Learning to teach others.

---

The first class graduated after one year.

Twelve students. Twelve new teachers.

They went out into the world. They started training others. The network began to spread—not of criminals, but of defenders.

"It's working," Elena said.

"It's a start." Sarah looked at the students. "But it's not enough."

"It never is."

"No." Sarah smiled. "It never is."
