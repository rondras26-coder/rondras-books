# CHAPTER TWENTY: THE CIRCLE CONTINUES

*Extended Version*

---

Seventy-five years after Geneva.

The Chen Institute had become a university.

Thousands of students. Hundreds of professors. A global network of campuses.

And the lesson had spread beyond anything Sarah had imagined.

---

A new teacher stood at the front of a classroom.

Her name was Maya. She was twenty-five years old, a recent graduate, full of hope.

"Today," she said, "I'm going to tell you about the hesitation."

She thought about her grandmother. About Emma. About Sarah.

"The hesitation," she said, "is the moment when we see ourselves clearly."

She paused.

"But here's what they don't tell you. The hesitation isn't just about fear. It's about courage. It's about choosing to act even when you're scared."

A hand went up.

"How do you know when to trust yourself?" the student asked.

Maya smiled.

"You don't," she said honestly. "That's the terrible part. You never know for certain."

She thought about Sarah Chen. About the legacy. About the circle.

"All you can do is trust the feeling and act anyway."

---

The lesson continued.

It would always continue.

That was the circle. That was the point.
