Forty-five years after Geneva.

But she wasn't afraid.

She had lived a full life. Taught thousands of students. Changed the world.

Now it was time to let go.

Her students gathered around her bed.

Elena. Marcus. Rosa. Li Wei. Emma.

All of them, there to say goodbye.

"Teacher." Elena's voice was steady. "We've come to thank you."

Sarah smiled. "For what?"

"For everything. For the lesson. For the guidance. For showing us who we could be."

"You did the work. I just showed you the door."

"And you were right." Marcus stepped forward. "It's up to us to walk through."

Sarah looked at each of them.

"The lesson continues," she said. "That's what matters. Not me. Not the techniques. The lesson."

"We know," Rosa said. "We'll carry it forward."

Sarah closed her eyes.

And in that moment, she felt peace.

The next morning, Sarah Chen died.

 peacefully in her sleep.

She was one hundred years old.

The funeral was massive.

Thousands of people attended. Students from around the world. World leaders. Ordinary citizens.

They came to honor the woman who had changed everything.

They came to say goodbye.

---

Emma stood at the graveside, holding a flower.

She thought about her grandmother. About the lessons. About the hesitation.

And she made a promise.

She would continue the legacy. She would teach the next generation.

That was the circle. That was the point.
