# CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: THE FAMILY LEGACY

*Extended Version*

---

Forty years after Geneva.

Sarah had grandchildren now.

Three of them. All different. All special.

They visited her every Sunday. Brought her food, told her stories, listened to her ramble about the old days.

One of them—a girl named Emma, sixteen years old—was especially interested in the work.

"Grandma," she said one day, "can you teach me?"

Sarah smiled. "Teach you what?"

"The hesitation. The technique. Everything you taught."

"You want to be a negotiator?"

"I want to help people." Emma's eyes were bright. "Like you did."

Sarah looked at her granddaughter—this young woman, full of hope and determination.

"Okay," she said. "Let's start."

---

The first lesson was simple.

"Sit down," Sarah said. "Close your eyes."

Emma obeyed.

"Now, think about a time when you were scared. When you hesitated."

Emma's face twitched. A memory.

"What do you feel?"

"Fear," Emma whispered. "Doubt."

"Good. That's the hesitation. That's the moment when you see yourself clearly."

"How do I get past it?"

"You don't. You accept it. You use it."

Emma opened her eyes. "I don't understand."

"The hesitation isn't your enemy. It's your guide. It tells you where to grow."

Emma was quiet for a moment.

"Okay," she said. "I think I get it."

---

The next few weeks, Sarah taught Emma everything she knew.

About reading people. About finding the hesitation. About trusting yourself.

And about the cost.

"It's not easy," Sarah said one day. "Being a teacher. Being a guide. You see so much pain. So much suffering."

"But you also see hope."

"Yes." Sarah smiled. "That's the best part."

Emma nodded. "I want to do this. For the rest of my life."

"Then do it." Sarah took her granddaughter's hand. "That's the choice. That's the hesitation. And that's the answer."

---

Emma went on to become one of the youngest graduates of the Chen Institute.

She became a teacher. A mentor. A guide.

And she carried the legacy forward.
