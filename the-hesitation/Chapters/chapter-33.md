# CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE

## The Truth

---

Three weeks after the trial, Sarah sat in her office at Quantico, staring at the folder in front of her.

James Morrison. Her former student. The man who had kidnapped her daughter. The man who had told her everything she wanted to know—yet had given no answers.

She opened the folder.

There was no new information. Just the old facts she already knew: James had been brilliant. James had been talented. James had fallen.

And she hadn't seen it.

Her phone rang.

"Dr. Chen?" A male voice. Unknown. "It's me. James."

She froze. "How did you get this number—"

"That doesn't matter." His voice sounded different. Empty. The voice of a man who had lost everything. "I need to meet you."

"Why?"

"Because I have to tell you the truth. About everything."

Sarah closed her eyes. The last time James had called her, it had been a trap. This time... this time could be different. Or it could be the same trap, dressed up in different clothing.

"Where?"

"The old warehouse at the harbor. Tomorrow. 10 a.m."

"Alone?"

"Alone."

The call ended.

Sarah didn't sleep that night.

She lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, replaying every conversation she'd ever had with James. The training sessions, the case studies, the late-night conversations about philosophy and psychology and the nature of human motivation. She had seen something in him—potential, brilliance, a hunger to make a difference. And she had missed the darkness underneath.

*Why didn't I see it?* The question had haunted her for years. *Why didn't I notice the signs?*

But she knew the answer. She had been too focused on the job, too caught up in her own career, too trusting of the system. She had believed that training could fix anything, that technique could overcome trauma, that a good student would always remain good.

She had been wrong.

The warehouse was cold. Winter air drifted through the broken windows.

James stood in the middle of the room, surrounded by shadows. He looked even worse than the last time she'd seen him—thinner, paler, more haunted. But there was something else in his eyes now. Something that looked almost like hope.

"You came," he said.

"You lied to me." Sarah stepped closer. "You said you'd tell me the truth."

"I will." He turned around. "But first you have to understand why."

"Why what?"

"Why I did what I did. Why I kidnapped Lily. Why I lied to you."

Sarah stopped. "Alright. Tell me the truth."

James took a deep breath. "Marcus Webb isn't the leader. He's just a tool. There's someone above him. Someone nobody knows. Someone pulling the strings."

"Who?"

"That's the truth I can't tell you." He shook his head. "Not because I don't want to. But because I don't know it myself. I only know that everything is bigger than we think. The network. The corruption. The truth."

"You don't know?"

"I only know that Marcus was part of something larger. Something that spanned governments, corporations, organizations. Something that had been operating for decades."

"And you're just now telling me this?"

"I wasn't sure before." He looked at her. "But now I am. Because I want you to understand—the things I did, the things I was forced to do—they weren't just about Marcus. They were about something much bigger. And now that he's gone, the network is still out there. Still operating. Still dangerous."

Sarah stared at him. This was insane. This was the kind of paranoid conspiracy theory she had spent her career dismissing. But there was something in his voice—desperation, sincerity, fear—that made her listen.

"What do you want me to do?"

"I want you to be careful." He moved toward the door. "The people I'm talking about—they have eyes everywhere. They know things they shouldn't know. And if they find out you've been asking questions..."

He didn't finish the sentence. He didn't have to.
