# CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

## Shadows of the Past

---

The call came at 3 AM.

Sarah groggily reached for her phone on the nightstand. The screen glowed in the darkness, the caller ID showing an unknown number. California.

"Hello?"

"Dr. Chen." The voice was familiar. Haunted. Familiar in a way that made her stomach drop. "It's James."

She sat up, suddenly awake, her heart pounding. "James? How did you get this number?"

"It doesn't matter." He sounded different. Calmer. But not the calm of peace—the calm of emptiness. "I need to tell you something. Before it's too late."

"Too late for what?"

"The network." His voice dropped, barely above a whisper. "Marcus wasn't alone. There are others. People he trained. People who are still out there. People who are still dangerous."

Sarah's blood ran cold. "Who? Give me names."

"I can't. Not over the phone. It's not safe—there are ears everywhere, eyes in every corner." A pause. "Meet me. Tomorrow. The old warehouse at Pier 39. 10 AM. Come alone."

"James—"

"Please, Sarah." His voice cracked, just slightly. "This is the only way I can make it right. The only way I can atone for what I've done."

The line went dead.

Sarah sat in the darkness, the phone still pressed to her ear, her mind racing. This could be a trap. It probably was. After everything that had happened, after everything James had done, why would she trust him?

But there was something in his voice. Something urgent. Something desperate.

*He's trying to make amends*, she thought. *He's trying to find redemption.*

And who was she to deny him that chance?

The next morning, Sarah drove to Pier 39.

The old pier was abandoned now, the tourist shops closed five years ago, leaving only rust and memories. Seagulls circled overhead, their cries echoing off the decaying buildings. The air smelled of salt and decay.

The warehouse stood at the end of the pier, a skeletal reminder of San Francisco's industrial past. Sarah approached carefully, her training taking over. No guards. No weapons. Just an old man sitting on a crate, staring at the bay.

James.

He looked different. Thinner. Older. His hair had gone grey at the temples, and there were lines around his eyes that hadn't been there before. But his eyes—his eyes were the same. Haunted. Brilliant. Lost.

"You came," he said without turning.

"You asked me to."

"I wasn't sure you would." He finally looked at her. "After everything."

"Tell me about the network."

James laughed bitterly. "The network. Always the network." He shook his head. "It's not what you think, Sarah. It's not about money or power. It's about control. About changing the system from within."

"You're talking about terrorism."

"I'm talking about revolution." He stood, walked to the water's edge, his back to her. "The FBI is corrupt. The government is corrupt. Marcus saw it. I saw it. We wanted to change it."

"By kidnapping my daughter? By framing innocent people?"

"By any means necessary." He turned to face her. "I know you don't understand. You never did. That's why you were never part of it."

Sarah stepped forward. "Then let me understand now. Help me see what you saw."

James hesitated. For a moment, she saw the student she'd trained. The brilliant young man who'd wanted to save the world. The one who had been broken by Marcus's manipulations.

"It's too late," he said. "For me, at least. But for you—maybe not. Maybe you can finish what we started."

"How?"

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a flash drive.

"Everything. Names, locations, operations. It's all here." He held it out. "Take it. Use it. Make it right."

Sarah took the drive. It was small, light, cold in her palm. "James—"

"Don't." His voice broke. "Don't say my name like you care. You never did. None of you did. You trained me, but you never saw me. You taught me, but you never understood me."

He walked away, his silhouette disappearing into the morning fog.

Sarah stood alone on the pier, the flash drive in her hand, the weight of the world on her shoulders.
