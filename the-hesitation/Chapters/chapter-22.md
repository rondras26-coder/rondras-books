# CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

## The Mountain Cabin

---

The cabin sat at the end of a winding road, surrounded by towering pines. Sarah parked a quarter mile out and approached on foot.

Six hours. That's what Elena had given her. Six hours before Marcus decided Lily was no longer useful.

She moved through the trees, her training taking over. Three surveillance cameras. Two guards on rotation. Standard patterns.

She took out the first guard with a quiet chokehold. The second never saw her coming.

Inside, Lily sat绑 in a chair, but her eyes were alive. Alert. Watching.

And then James appeared in the doorway.

"Sarah." His voice was calm. Too calm. "I was wondering when you'd come."

"Let her go, James."

"You know I can't do that."

"You can." Sarah stepped forward. "You're not a monster. I trained you. I know what's in there."

"What you trained was a weapon." James's voice cracked. "What Marcus made is something else entirely."

"Then prove it. Lower the gun. Help me stop him."

"It's not that simple."

"It never is." Sarah moved closer. "But Lily is not part of this. She's innocent."

"So was everyone else Marcus destroyed." James's hand trembled. "Including me."

Lily spoke for the first time. "James."

He looked at her.

"I know who you are," Lily said quietly. "I know what she did to you. But I'm not her. I'm not part of this."

"No. You're not."

"Then let me go."

James hesitated. Just for a moment. But Sarah saw it.

The hesitation.
