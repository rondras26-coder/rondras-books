# CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

## The Return to the Classroom

*Extended Version*

---

Fifteen years after the training center opened.

Sarah was seventy years old.

She still taught, though not as often. Her body was failing—arthritis in her joints, a heart that stumbled sometimes—but her mind was sharp.

The students came from everywhere. Law enforcement. Intelligence. Corporate. Medical.

All of them, learning the same lesson.

One day, a young woman approached her.

"Dr. Chen. Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"How do you know when to trust yourself?"

Sarah smiled. It was the same question she'd been asked a thousand times.

"You don't," she said honestly. "That's the terrible part. You never know for certain."

The woman's face fell.

"But you do it anyway." Sarah put a hand on her shoulder. "That's what courage is. Not certainty. Faith."

"I don't understand."

"The hesitation is the moment when you see yourself clearly. When you stop pretending. And then—" She paused. "You choose. You act. You trust."

"That's terrifying."

"Yes." Sarah nodded. "It is."
