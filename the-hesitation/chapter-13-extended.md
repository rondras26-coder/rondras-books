# CHAPTER THIRTEEN

## The Pattern Revealed

*Extended Version*

---

One year after Prague.

The voice from the recording had been identified.

Daniel Price. A former FBI psychologist, discharged ten years ago after a mental breakdown. He'd been a hostage negotiator—trained by Sarah herself, though she'd never met him.

"He's brilliant," Reyes said. "Top of his class. But something went wrong."

"What kind of wrong?"

"Paranoia. Delusions. He started believing he could see patterns that didn't exist."

"But he did see patterns. He just... misinterpreted them."

"That's what makes him dangerous. He thinks he's saving the world. He's not. He's destroying it."

Sarah listened to the recordings again. The voice. The hesitation. The pattern.

Daniel wasn't just following the pattern. He was creating it.

The investigation led to a compound in rural Virginia.

Sarah watched from the van outside, heart pounding.

"Three hostiles," the team leader said. "We count three hostiles inside."

"What about the target?"

"Unknown. Could be anywhere."

Sarah looked at the building. Simple structure. White walls. No windows.

"It's him," she said. "I know it's him."

"How?"

"I can feel it."

The team leader hesitated. Then nodded.

"We go in in five minutes."

The raid was quick. Clean.

Three men, all armed, all neutralized within seconds.

And in the basement, tied to a chair: Daniel Price.

He looked up at Sarah. Smiled.

"Dr. Chen. I wondered when you'd come."

"How did you know it was me?"

"I've always known. You're the best, Sarah. The very best. That's why I had to beat you."

"What do you mean?"

"The pattern. The hesitation. It's not enough to recognize it. You have to control it. You have to use it."

"That's not what I teach."

"No. You're too soft. Too emotional." Daniel's eyes were flat. "That's why I'll win."

Sarah stared at him. This wasn't just a criminal. This was something else.

A true believer.
