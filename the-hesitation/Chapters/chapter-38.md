# CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT

## The Memory

---

Five years later.

Sarah sat in a café in Paris. She had changed – the grey hair, the wrinkles she didn't used to have, the lines around her eyes that spoke of years of worry and loss. But her eyes were still sharp. Still watching. Still looking for the truth.

The café was crowded, filled with locals and tourists, the hum of conversation filling the air. She had come to Paris for a conference—a book launch, actually. Her memoir had become a bestseller, translated into dozens of languages, read by millions. "The Truth Behind the Hesitation" – the story of a mother who saved her child and uncovered a conspiracy.

But there were still questions. Still doubts. Still moments when she wondered if she had done enough.

Her phone rang. Unknown number.

She hesitated. These days, she was more careful about answering unknown calls. But something made her pick up.

"Yes?"

"Dr. Chen." A voice she knew. A voice she thought she'd never hear again. "It's time."

"James?" She froze. "You're alive?"

"I was never dead." He laughed softly, but there was an edge to it. "But I need you again."

"Why?"

"Because they're back. The Architects. Or what's left of them. And this time it's personal."

Sarah closed her eyes. She had known it wasn't over. The network had been too big, too entrenched, to be dismantled in one fell swoop. There would always be survivors, always be remnants, always be people trying to rebuild what had been destroyed.

But she had hoped—prayed—that she would be left in peace.

"Where?"

"Montreal. Tomorrow. Old library. The one on Saint Laurent."

So they would continue. Chasing the truth. Until the last lie was uncovered.
