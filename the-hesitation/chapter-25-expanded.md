# CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE

## A New Beginning

---

Three months later.

The café in Berkeley was crowded, filled with students and professors, the hum of conversation filling the air. Sarah sat at a corner table, a cup of coffee cooling in her hands, watching the door.

Lily was late. That was unlike her.

Just as Sarah was starting to worry, the door burst open and Lily rushed in, flushed and apologetic.

"Sorry, Mom! The train was delayed, and then I couldn't find parking, and—" She stopped, catching her breath. "But I'm here. I'm here."

"You're here," Sarah agreed, smiling. "That's all that matters."

Lily sat down across from her, grabbing the menu despite having probably already decided what she wanted. She looked different now—older, more confident, more alive. The trauma of the kidnapping had left scars, but it had also left wisdom. Lily had been through hell and come out the other side.

"So," Sarah said, "you said you had something to tell me."

Lily's face lit up. "Yes! I got the acceptance letter yesterday. I was going to tell you on the phone, but I wanted to do it in person."

"Acceptance letter? What acceptance letter?"

"Med school." Lily couldn't contain her excitement. "I got into med school. Berkeley. Starting in the fall."

Sarah's eyes welled with tears. "Med school? That's—Lily, that's amazing!"

"I know!" Lily reached across the table, grabbing her mother's hands. "I know it's crazy, and I know it's a lot of work, and I know you probably think I'm insane, but I want to do it. I want to help people. The way you do."

"Lily, I never thought you were insane. Not once."

"Yeah, well." Lily laughed, a little nervously. "There were a few times when I wondered if I was making a huge mistake."

"A mistake? Why?"

"Because—" Lily's smile faded slightly. "Because I didn't want to do it because of what happened. I didn't want to become a doctor just because I was kidnapped and almost died. I wanted to do it because I genuinely wanted to help people."

Sarah squeezed her daughter's hands. "And do you? Want to help people?"

"Yes." Lily's voice was firm. "More than anything. After everything that happened—after seeing what Marcus did, what the network did, how broken people can hurt others—I want to be part of the solution. I want to help people who are broken. I want to help them heal."

Sarah felt the tears spill over, rolling down her cheeks. "That's my girl."

"Thanks to you."

"No." Sarah shook her head. "Thanks to you. You saved yourself, Lily. While you were in that cabin, while you were trapped and scared and alone—you saved yourself. I just... I just gave you the tools."

"And now I'm going to give other people those tools." Lily smiled, her eyes bright. "In a different way. Through medicine. Through healing. Through actually making a difference."

Sarah laughed, wiping her eyes. "When did you get so wise?"

"When I spent three months being kidnapped by a crazy man." Lily shrugged. "You learn a lot about perspective."

They ordered food—salads and sandwiches, the kind of healthy, conscious choices they both made now—and talked for hours. About med school, about the future, about everything and nothing. It was the kind of conversation Sarah had dreamed about for years, the kind of connection she had almost lost.

After lunch, they walked through the campus together, arm in arm, taking in the sights and sounds of academic life. Students rushed past, books in hand, faces bent toward screens and notes. The energy was palpable, the sense of possibility intoxicating.

"I could see you here," Sarah said. "I can see you walking between lectures, studying in the library, making friends, building a life."

"I can see it too." Lily paused, turning to face her mother. "Mom, I want to thank you. For everything. For coming for me. For never giving up. For... for being you."

Sarah pulled her daughter into a hug, holding her tight. "I'll always come for you," she whispered. "That's what mothers do. That's what I'll always do."

"I know." Lily's voice was muffled against her shoulder. "I know."

Later that evening, Sarah sat alone on her porch, watching the sun set over the Berkeley hills. The sky was painted in shades of orange and pink, the light soft and golden, the world at peace.

Her phone buzzed. A text from David: *How did it go?*

She typed back: *She got into med school.*

A moment later, his reply: *That's wonderful. I'm proud of her. I'm proud of you.*

Sarah smiled, typing: *We did it together.*

She put the phone away, leaning back in her chair. The stars were starting to appear, one by one, like diamonds scattered across black velvet. The future was uncertain—there were still challenges ahead, still healing to be done, still questions without answers.

But for now, in this moment, everything was perfect.
