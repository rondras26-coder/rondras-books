# CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN

## A New Beginning

---

Three months later.

Sarah sat in a café in Berkeley, across from Lily. Their relationship was different now. Harder won, more honest.

"Mom, I got into med school."

Sarah's eyes lit up. "Really?"

"Really." Lily smiled. "But I need to tell you something first."

"What?"

"I'm not doing this because of what happened. I'm doing it because I want to help people. The way you do."

Sarah reached across the table and took her daughter's hand.

"You already help people, Lily. Every day."

"Thanks to you."

"No." Sarah shook her head. "Thanks to you. You saved yourself. I just... gave you the tools."

Lily laughed. "And now I'm going to give other people those tools. In a different way."

Sarah smiled. "That's my girl."
