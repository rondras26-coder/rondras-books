# CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE

## The Reckoning

Six months later.

Sarah sat in the courtroom, watching Marcus Webb being led away in chains. The trial had lasted three weeks. The verdict took the jury four hours.

Guilty on all counts.

James Morrison, who had been found in a cabin in Montana, half-starved, delirious. Who had spent four months in a psychiatric facility. Who had refused to see her, refused to speak, refused to acknowledge that any of it had happened.

"Let's go," David said. "It's over."

"Is it?" Sarah looked back at the empty courtroom. "Is it really?"

Lily took her mother's hand. "It's over, Mom. It's time to let go."

Sarah nodded. But the hesitation in her heart remained—the question that would never be answered.

What if I had seen it sooner?
