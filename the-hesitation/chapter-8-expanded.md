# CHAPTER EIGHT: THE STUDENTS

*Extended Version*

---

Two years after Geneva.

The call came at midnight.

Sarah's phone—the same one she always kept by her bed.

"Dr. Chen." The voice was male. Young. Nervous. "I need your help."

"Who is this?"

"My name is Marcus. I'm a student at the Institute. I've been trained in your techniques."

Sarah sat up in bed. "What's the situation?"

"There's been an incident. A shooting. At a shopping mall. The shooter is still inside. I'm outside. I don't know what to do."

Sarah was already out of bed, reaching for her clothes. "Are you armed?"

"No. I don't carry a gun."

"Can you get in?"

"I don't know. The police have the building surrounded."

"What's your position?"

"Near the east entrance. I can see the shooter through the window. He's got maybe fifteen people hostage."

Sarah's mind raced. "Listen carefully. You need to find the hesitation."

"The what?"

"The hesitation. The moment when his mask slips. Watch for it."

"I don't—I can't—"

"You can. Trust yourself. You've been trained."

A pause. Long enough for Sarah to hear his breathing.

"Okay," Marcus said. "Okay. I'm going in."

---

The mall was chaos.

Police cars. Ambulances. News helicopters circling overhead.

Sarah arrived forty minutes after the call. She pushed through the barricade, showed her credentials, was led to the command post.

"Dr. Chen." The incident commander—a grizzled veteran—nodded. "We didn't call you."

"I came on my own. What's the status?"

"The shooter is in the food court. He's got eighteen hostages. He's demanded a helicopter and $5 million."

"Has anyone talked to him?"

"We've tried. He won't negotiate. Just keeps saying we should all die."

Sarah nodded. "Where's Marcus?"

"Inside. Near the east entrance. We tried to get him out, but he wouldn't go."

---

Sarah approached the east entrance. Through the glass, she could see the food court. The shooter—a young man, early twenties, dressed in black—was pacing back and forth. His gun was raised.

And nearby, hiding behind a pillar, was Marcus.

Sarah pressed the button on her radio. "Marcus. Can you hear me?"

A pause. Then: "Yes."

"Talk to me. What do you see?"

"He's scared," Marcus said. "I can see it. Under the aggression, under the rage—he's terrified."

"Good. Use that. Find the hesitation."

"I've been watching. There's a pattern. Every few minutes, he pauses. Looks around. His hands shake."

"That's the hesitation. That's your window."

"What do I say?"

"Tell him you understand. Tell him you're scared too. Tell him he doesn't have to do this."

---

The next thirty minutes were the longest of Sarah's life.

She listened through the radio as Marcus approached the shooter. She heard his voice—steady, calm, empathetic.

"Hey." Marcus's voice. "I know you're scared. I am too."

"Stay back." The shooter's voice. High. Shaking. "I'll shoot."

"I know you will. But I also know you don't want to. That's why you're hesitating."

Silence. Then: "You don't know anything about me."

"I know you didn't plan this. I know something happened. Something that made you feel like you had no other choice."

Another pause. Longer this time.

"My mom." The shooter's voice cracked. "She died. Last month. And no one cared. No one—"

"I care." Marcus's voice was soft. "I care. That's why I'm here."

---

The shooter lowered his gun.

He was crying now—sobs that shook his whole body. Marcus approached slowly, carefully, and put a hand on his shoulder.

"It's okay," Marcus said. "It's okay. We're going to get through this together."

The police moved in.

The hostages were freed.

And Marcus walked out of the mall, shaking, but alive.

---

The next morning, Sarah found him in the Institute's courtyard.

"You saved those people," she said.

Marcus looked up. His eyes were red—from crying, from lack of sleep. "I was terrified."

"I know. That's why you succeeded."

"How?"

"Because you found the hesitation. You saw past the mask."

Marcus was quiet for a moment.

"I almost froze," he said. "When I first went in. I almost ran."

"But you didn't."

"I thought about what you taught us. About trusting ourselves. About the moment between what we are and what we want to be."

"And?"

"And I chose to act." Marcus smiled. "I chose to trust myself."

Sarah nodded. "That's the lesson."
