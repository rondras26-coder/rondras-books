# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

## The Memorial

*Extended Version*

---

Two years after Daniel's capture.

The memorial was held at the Quantico training center.

Sarah stood at the podium, looking out at the crowd. Law enforcement officers. Politicians. Journalists. All there to honor the victims.

But mostly, there were families.

Parents who'd lost children. Children who'd lost parents. Brothers, sisters, friends.

Sarah's voice was steady as she spoke.

"We remember them," she said. "We honor them. And we promise to continue the fight."

She thought about James. About Daniel. About all the others who'd been lost.

"The network is still out there," she continued. "But so are we. So is the truth. And in the end, the truth will win."

After the service, Sarah walked to the memorial wall.

Names. Hundreds of them. All the victims.

She placed a flower at the base.

"I'm sorry," she whispered. "I'm sorry I couldn't save you."

The wind blew. The flowers rustled.

And somewhere, in the distance, Sarah heard something.

A sound. Faint. Like a voice.

She turned. Looked.

Nothing.

But she felt it. The hesitation. The pattern.

Someone was watching.
