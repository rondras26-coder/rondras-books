# CHAPTER THIRTY

## The Investigation Begins

---

The first week was the hardest.

Sarah spent seventy-two hours without sleep, going through the files on the flash drive. Names, dates, locations, operations—the scope was staggering. This wasn't just a network; it was a shadow government, operating beneath the surface of public life.

She made lists. She cross-referenced information. She reached out to contacts she hadn't spoken to in years—people who owed her favors, people who trusted her, people who could help verify what she was seeing.

And slowly, piece by piece, the picture began to form.

David arrived in San Francisco on the third day.

"I brought everything I could find," he said, dumping a stack of folders on the hotel table. "Personal files, official records, anything that might be connected."

Sarah looked at the folders. "This could take months."

"Months we don't have." David sat down heavily, exhaustion evident in every line of his face. "The President is asking questions. Congress is asking questions. Everyone wants to know what's on that flash drive."

"It's not ready."

"When will it be ready?"

Sarah didn't answer. She didn't know.

The second week brought breakthroughs.

A name surfaced in the files that Sarah recognized: Senator Howard Vance. He had been a rising star in the party, a champion of law and order, a man who had built his career on being tough on crime. But according to the files, he had been meeting with Marcus Webb for years—passing information, making deals, protecting the network.

"He's untouchable," David said when she showed him the evidence. "He's got too many allies, too much power."

"Everyone's untouchable until they're not." Sarah printed out the files, stacking them carefully. "I'm going to find someone who can help."

"Who?"

"Someone who knows the inside. Someone who has nothing left to lose."

Elena Morrison agreed to meet her in a coffee shop in Oakland.

She looked healthier than the last time Sarah had seen her—color in her cheeks, light in her eyes. The art was helping, she said. The therapy was helping. But there was still a long way to go.

"I thought you'd be in hiding," Sarah said.

"I was. For a while." Elena stirred her coffee, watching the swirls of cream dissolve. "But I decided that running wasn't living. I wanted to actually live, for once."

"That's brave."

"That's necessary." Elena looked up. "You said you needed my help."

"I need to know about the Architects. The network. Everything Marcus didn't tell me."

Elena was quiet for a long moment. "It's bigger than you think. Deeper. The Architects—they're not just criminals. They're ideologues. They believe they're saving the world."

"Saving it from what?"

"From itself." Elena's voice was bitter. "They think the system is broken beyond repair. They think the only way to fix it is from outside—through manipulation, through control, through making the hard choices that elected officials are too weak to make."

"That's insane."

"Maybe. But they have resources, connections, patience. They think in decades, not election cycles. They're playing a long game, Sarah. And they've been winning."

Sarah leaned forward. "How do I stop them?"

Elena met her eyes. "You find someone on the inside. Someone who can give you evidence. Someone who can testify."

"Who?"

"I don't know. But if anyone can find them, it's you." Elena stood, leaving cash on the table for the coffee. "Be careful, Sarah. These people—they don't forgive traitors. And they don't forget."
