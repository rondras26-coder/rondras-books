# CHAPTER SEVEN

## The Leak

The booking photo showed a young man with tired eyes and a half-smile that didn't reach them. Daniel Price. Thirty-one. Former Army psychologist.

"He's been following James's methods," Reyes said, handing her the file. "Same signature. Same patterns. We think he's a copycat."

Sarah shook her head. "He's not a copycat. He's a student."

"What?"

"A student of what I taught James. And James taught him." She felt the weight settle. "I created this chain. Me → James → Daniel."

"That's not—"

"It is." She stood. "And I need to stop it."

---

The interrogation room smelled like burnt coffee and institutional despair.

Daniel Price sat on one side of the table; Sarah on the other.

He was younger than she'd expected. Thinner. The kind of lean that came from stress, not exercise.

"Dr. Chen," he said. "I was hoping you'd come."

"Why?"

"Because you're the only one who understands."

"Understands what?"

"What I'm trying to do."

Sarah leaned back. "You're trying to kill people. The Henderson family. That's what you're trying to do."

"I'm trying to teach." His voice was calm. Reasonable. "Just like you taught me."

"I never taught you to kill."

"You taught me to see. To notice the hesitation. To recognize the moment when someone's mask slips." He smiled. "You taught me to be a mirror. And mirrors reflect everything."

"The Henderson family didn't ask for your help."

"The Hendersons were corrupt. You know that. The father was running a Ponzi scheme. The mother knew."

Sarah's hands tightened on the table. "What's the price?"

"Clarity. Understanding. The truth." He spread his hands. "I'm not a killer, Dr. Chen. I'm a teacher."

---

The flashback came that night.

Sarah was lying in bed, unable to sleep, when the memory surfaced—sharp and unexpected.

*Quantico, twenty years ago. A classroom full of trainees. James Morrison in the front row, eyes bright, hand raised.*

*"What's the hesitation?" he'd asked.*

*She'd smiled. "It's the moment between what they are and what they want to be. The split second where their mask slips."*

*"How do you spot it?"*

*"You can't learn to spot it. You can only learn to stop ignoring it."*

He'd nodded. Written it down. Asked a dozen more questions.

At the end of the session, he'd stayed behind.

*"Dr. Chen," he'd said. "I want to be like you. I want to be able to see people. Really see them."*

She'd patted his shoulder. "You will be. You have the gift."

The memory dissolved. Sarah lay in the dark, heart pounding.

She'd created him. Not the monster—the monster had always been there. But the weapon. The technique. She'd handed him the knife and taught him how to use it.

---

The next morning, she went back to the FBI.

"We've identified three more victims," Reyes said. "All connected to Daniel Price's former unit. Two soldiers from his Afghanistan deployment. One contractor."

"All executed?"

"All shot in the head. Same signature."

Sarah nodded. "He's not just killing. He's making a point."

"About what?"

"About what he learned. About what he saw in the war. These aren't random victims. They're people who did something. Betrayed someone."

"We're still building the profile."

"I know what the profile says." She pulled up the file on her laptop. "He was Army psychologist. Saw combat. Came home, couldn't adjust. Enrolled in my workshop three weeks before the Henderson murders."

"That's not much to go on."

"It's enough." She pointed to a line in the psychological evaluation. "'Subject displays an unusual attachment to authority figures.' That's the same language as James's file."

"You think he's following James?"

"I think he's studying both of us." She closed the laptop. "James taught him the methodology. I taught him the theory. Now he's putting it into practice."

Reyes stared at her. "This is getting out of hand."

"This has been out of hand since the Harrison case." Sarah stood. "Fifteen years ago, I created a monster. And now I've created another one. Maybe it's time to stop creating and start understanding."

---

She went to see James that afternoon.

Maximum security. The guards led her through three locked doors, down a grey corridor, into a room with a glass wall.

James was already there. Older than she remembered. Thinner. But his eyes were the same—intense, focused, still hungry for something she couldn't name.

"Sarah." He smiled. "I wondered when you'd come."

"You knew about Daniel Price."

"I know about a lot of things."

"Tell me."

"Daniel found me three years ago. Wrote me letters. Dozens of them. He wanted to understand. To learn. He was lost, just like I was."

"And you taught him."

"I taught him what you taught me. The hesitation. The pattern. The importance of seeing the truth." He paused. "But I also taught him something you never did."

"What?"

"How to let go. How to stop caring about the judgment. How to become the monster instead of pretending to be human."

Sarah felt the words like a knife.

"You're not a monster, James. You never were."

"That's what you think. But you know the truth. You've always known." He stood, walked to the glass. "Daniel is doing what I couldn't. He's finishing what I started. He's making you see what you've done."

"What I've done?"

"You created us. You taught us to see. And then you abandoned us when we needed you most." His voice cracked. "I needed you, Sarah. And you looked away."

"I was trying to protect—"

"Protect yourself." He turned back. "That's what you do. That's what you've always done. The Chen Calm. The great Sarah Chen, too professional to feel anything."

"I felt plenty."

"Then why didn't you act?"

The question hung in the air.

"Because I was afraid," Sarah said quietly. "Because I thought if I followed my gut, I might be wrong. And being wrong would mean I wasn't special anymore."

James stared at her.

"That's the truth," she continued. "That's what I've never told anyone. I was afraid of being ordinary. So I ignored my instincts, and people died. And I've spent fifteen years trying to make up for it."

"And now?"

"Now I'm trying to do better." She looked at him through the glass. "That's why I need to understand Daniel. Why I need to reach him before it's too late."

James was quiet for a long moment.

"He's at the hotel," he said finally. "The Marriott on K Street. Room 412. He's waiting for you."

"How do you know?"

"Because that's what I would do." James smiled—sad, almost gentle. "He's not a monster, Sarah. Not yet. He's just lost. Like I was."

"Like I made him."

"Yes." James turned away. "Like you made him."

---

The Marriott on K Street was a grey building in a grey part of downtown.

Sarah parked across the street, watched the windows.

Room 412 was on the fourth floor. The curtains were drawn. No movement visible.

She got out of the car. Walked toward the entrance.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Reyes:

*SWAT is staged 2 minutes out. Give the signal when ready.*

She didn't answer.

The lobby was empty. The elevator smelled like cleaning solution and old carpet. She rode it to the fourth floor, walked down the corridor, stopped at room 412.

Knocked.

The door opened.

Daniel Price stood in the doorway. He was wearing a t-shirt and jeans, no shoes. He looked tired, but calm.

"Dr. Chen," he said. "I knew you'd come."

"I need to understand."

"Then come in."

She stepped inside.

The room was sparse. A bed, a desk, a laptop open on the desk. On the wall, photographs. Dozens of them. Crime scenes. Victims. Notes.

And in the center, a photograph of Sarah.

"You've been watching me," she said.

"I've been studying you. For years." He sat on the edge of the bed. "You're the best, Dr. Chen. The greatest negotiator the FBI ever produced."

"By trusting my instincts."

"No." He shook his head. "That's what you tell people. That's the myth. But the truth is more complicated."

"What is the truth?"

"The truth is that you're afraid. You've always been afraid. Afraid of your own feelings. Afraid of what you'd see if you looked at yourself honestly." He stood, walked toward her. "That's why you freeze. That's why you miss the hesitation. Because you're too scared to really look."

Sarah didn't move.

"I can help you," Daniel said. "I can show you what you're afraid to see."

"I don't need your help."

"Yes, you do." He was close now. Close enough to touch. "You're stuck, Dr. Chen. You've been stuck for fifteen years. You need someone to show you the way."

"And what's the way?"

He smiled.

"The way is through the fear."

He reached into his pocket—

The door burst open.

SWAT officers poured in, weapons raised. Daniel spun, reached for something—

Sarah moved.

She grabbed his arm, twisted, brought him to the ground. He struggled, but she was faster.

"Don't move," she said, pinning him. "Don't you dare move."

He stopped.

Looked up at her.

"You came," he whispered. "You actually came."

"I came to understand."

"Did you?"

She looked at him—at the fear in his eyes, the hope, the desperate need to be seen.

"I came to stop you," she said. "Before you become something you can't come back from."

"Is that what you tell yourself?"

"Maybe." She stood, let the agents take him. "Maybe that's what I tell myself so I can keep going."

He was led away, still looking at her.

Sarah stood in the middle of the room, surrounded by photographs of her own face.

The student was caught.

But the lesson wasn't over.

Not yet.

---

Sarah Chen's legacy lived on in every student who learned to trust themselves. In every life that was saved. In every moment of courage.

That was the circle. That was the point.

**THE END**
