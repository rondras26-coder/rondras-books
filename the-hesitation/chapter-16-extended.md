# CHAPTER SIXTEEN

## The New Threat

*Extended Version*

---

Three years after the memorial.

The call came at midnight.

"Dr. Chen." Reyes's voice was urgent. "We have a situation."

"What now?"

"New network. Different from Daniel's. More sophisticated."

"How sophisticated?"

"Three cells. Simultaneous attacks. All in major cities."

"When?"

"48 hours."

Sarah felt her heart stop. Then start again, harder.

"Where?"

"New York. London. Tokyo."

"I'm on my way."

The next 48 hours were a blur.

Sarah coordinated with intelligence agencies worldwide. She tracked communications, analyzed patterns, searched for the hesitation.

And then, she found it.

A voice. In the background of one of the intercepted calls.

She recognized it.

Not a voice she knew personally. But a pattern. A hesitation.

It was someone new.

"Who is it?" Reyes asked.

"I don't know. But I know how they think."

"How?"

"They were trained by someone who was trained by me."

Reyes stared. "That's—"

"Three generations. The pattern spreads. That's what they do."

"Then how do we stop it?"

Sarah smiled grimly. "The same way we always do. We find the hesitation. We see the truth."
