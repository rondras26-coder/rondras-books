# THE HESITATION

## By Sarah Chen

### Acknowledgments

This novel would not have been possible without the help of many people.

To my students—you taught me more than I taught you.

To my daughter, Lily—you are my inspiration.

To the men and women who work in hostage negotiation, crisis management, and emotional intelligence—you are the real heroes.

And to everyone who has ever hesitated, doubted, or feared—you are not alone.
