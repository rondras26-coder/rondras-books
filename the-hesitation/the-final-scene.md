# THE FINAL SCENE

## Epilogue - One Hundred Years Later

The classroom was full. Again.

A young woman stood at the front. She was twenty years old, with bright eyes and an eager expression.

"My name is Emma," she said. "And I'm here to tell you about the hesitation."

She walked to the window. Outside, Quantico was golden in the autumn light.

"The hesitation," she said, "is the moment when our mask slips. It's the moment when we see ourselves clearly."

She turned back to face the students.

"But here's what they don't tell you. The hesitation isn't just about fear. It's about courage. It's about choosing to act even when you're scared."

A hand went up in the second row.

"How do you know when to trust yourself?" the student asked.

Emma smiled.

"You don't know," she said honestly. "That's the terrible part. You never know for certain."

She thought about Sarah Chen. About the legacy. About the circle.

"All you can do is trust the feeling and act anyway."

She looked at the students—at their eager faces, their bright eyes, their whole lives ahead of them.

"The hesitation isn't the enemy," she said. "The doubt isn't the enemy. The enemy is refusing to act on what you know."

She smiled.

"Trust yourselves. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard."

The students applauded.

And somewhere, in the great beyond, Sarah Chen smiled.

The circle was complete.
