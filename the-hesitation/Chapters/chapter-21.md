# CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

## Elena's Truth

---

Sarah's hands trembled as she held the file. Twenty-four hours. That's all James had given her.

The flight to Oregon took three hours. She spent them reviewing everything she knew about Elena Morrison.

James's sister. Declared dead fifteen years ago in the Harrison massacre. But according to Marcus Webb's encrypted files, she was very much alive.

The address led to a small house on the outskirts of Bend. The woman who answered the door looked like a ghost.

Elena.

"Sarah Chen," Elena said flatly. "I wondered when you'd come."

"You know why I'm here."

"Lily." Elena stepped aside. "Come in."

The house was modest, cluttered with books and art supplies. Elena moved carefully, like someone who had spent years learning to disappear.

"Marcus framed James," Elena said without preamble. "He made everyone believe I was dead so James would break. He used Sarah's own techniques against him."

"Where is my daughter?"

Elena met her eyes. "A cabin in the mountains. About four hours from here. But Sarah—"

"What's the address?"

"James isn't in control anymore. Marcus is. If you go in guns blazing—"

"I don't have a choice." Sarah stood. "Thank you."

"Sarah. Wait." Elena grabbed her arm. "James still has humanity. I've seen it. He struggles with every order Marcus gives him. Talk to him. Not as a negotiator. As his teacher."

Sarah nodded once and left.
