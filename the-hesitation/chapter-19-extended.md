# CHAPTER NINETEEN

## The Circle

*Extended Version*

---

Twenty years after the training center opened.

Sarah was seventy-five years old.

She didn't teach anymore. Her body was too weak. But her students taught for her.

The network had grown. Thousands of trained individuals, spread across the world. The pattern was being taught everywhere.

And the criminals—the ones who used the pattern for evil—were being caught.

---

One evening, Sarah received a letter.

It was from a young woman in Mexico. A student of one of Sarah's students.

*Dear Dr. Chen,*

*I wanted to thank you. I was going to join a gang. I was going to hurt people. But then I learned about the hesitation. I learned to see myself. I learned to choose.*

*Now I'm a teacher. I help kids like me. Kids who were lost.*

*Thank you for saving my life.*

*Sincerely,*
*Maria*

Sarah read the letter twice.

Then she smiled.

The circle was complete.
