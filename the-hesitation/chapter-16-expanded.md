# CHAPTER SIXTEEN: THE CHALLENGE

*Extended Version*

---

Thirty-five years after Geneva.

The world had changed.

Technology had advanced. Communication was instant. The Chen Institute had evolved.

But the fundamental challenges remained the same.

Sarah was ninety-five years old. She rarely left her house now. But she still taught.

Through video calls. Through her writings. Through her students.

The lesson continued.

---

The call came from Beijing.

"Dr. Chen." The voice was female. Young. "My name is Li Wei. I'm a student at the Beijing campus."

"Li Wei. What can I do for you?"

"There's a situation. We need your help."

"What kind of situation?"

"A crisis. Here in Beijing. A man has taken hostages in the subway. He's threatening to kill them all."

Sarah's heart seized. "Have you called the police?"

"They're en route. But we thought—maybe you could talk to him."

Sarah thought. She was old. Tired. But the lesson was still there.

"Put me through," she said.

---

The phone connection was poor. Static and noise.

But Sarah could hear him. The voice on the other end.

A man. Middle-aged. Angry.

"You don't know me," he said. "You don't know what I've been through."

"Tell me," Sarah said. "I'm listening."

"I've lost everything. My job. My family. My home. They took everything."

"Who took everything?"

"The system. The government. The rich. Everyone who has power."

Sarah listened. She didn't argue. She didn't judge.

She just listened.

And slowly, she heard it.

The hesitation.

A pause in his voice. A crack in the armor.

"You didn't want this," she said. "You never wanted this."

"How do you know?"

"I can hear it. In your voice. The hesitation."

He was silent.

"The hesitation," Sarah continued, "is the moment when you see yourself clearly. When you stop pretending."

"Stop pretending what?"

"That you want to hurt these people. That you want to die."

More silence.

"I don't want to die," he whispered.

"Then don't. It's not too late."

"I don't know how to—"

"You do. You just have to choose."

Another pause.

And then, finally: "Okay."

The line went dead.

---

The news report came an hour later.

The man had surrendered. The hostages were safe.

Sarah sat in her chair, exhausted but satisfied.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Li Wei:

*Thank you, Dr. Chen. You saved them all.*

Sarah typed back:

*We saved them together.*
