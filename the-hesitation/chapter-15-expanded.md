# CHAPTER FIFTEEN: THE RECRUIT

*Extended Version*

---

Thirty years after Geneva.

The Chen Institute had grown beyond anything Sarah had imagined.

Fifty campuses worldwide. Tens of thousands of students. The techniques had been adapted for use in medicine, education, business, diplomacy.

And now, a new generation of teachers was taking over.

Sarah was ninety years old. Her body was failing, but her mind was sharp.

She sat in her office, reviewing applications for the new semester.

A knock at the door.

"Come in."

Elena walked in. She was seventy now, grey-haired, but her eyes were the same.

"We have a candidate," she said. "I think you need to meet her."

"Who?"

"Her name is Rosa. From Mexico. She's... special."

---

Rosa was twenty-five years old.

She sat in Sarah's office, nervous but determined.

"Dr. Chen," she said. "Thank you for seeing me."

"Tell me about yourself."

Rosa took a deep breath. "I grew up in a cartel-controlled region. I saw violence every day. Death, corruption, fear."

Sarah nodded. "How did you survive?"

"I learned to read people. To see the hesitation. To find the moment when their mask slipped."

"How?"

"I had a teacher. A woman named Maria. She was a former police officer, trained in your techniques. She taught me everything."

"And now you want to teach others?"

"Yes." Rosa's voice was firm. "I want to help people like me. People who've seen too much. People who are broken."

Sarah looked at her—this young woman, full of hope and determination.

"Welcome to the Institute," she said.

---

Rosa's first class was a disaster.

She was nervous. Unprepared. The students didn't listen.

After class, she went to Sarah, crying.

"I can't do this," she said. "I'm not good enough."

Sarah took her hand.

"The hesitation," she said, "isn't just something you see in others. It's something you feel in yourself."

"What do you mean?"

"Every time you doubt yourself, every time you hesitate—that's the moment. The moment when you see yourself clearly."

"How do I get past it?"

"You don't. You accept it. You use it."

Rosa frowned. "Use it?"

"The hesitation is your guide. It tells you where you need to grow. Where you need to improve."

Rosa was quiet for a moment.

"Okay," she said finally. "I'll try."

---

The next semester, Rosa's class was different.

She was calmer. More confident. The students responded.

After class, Sarah found her in the courtyard.

"You did well," Sarah said.

Rosa smiled. "I learned from the best."

"You learned from yourself. That's the only way it works."
