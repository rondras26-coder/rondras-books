## The Plan

---

The next weeks, Sarah and James spent developing the plan.

It was complicated. Dangerous. Almost impossible.

But they had no choice.

"We need allies," Sarah said. "We can't do this alone."

James nodded. "I have contacts. People who still owe me favors."

"Who?"

He hesitated. "Former agents. Hackers. Even some judges who were corrupted but regret it."

"Regret?"

"They regret what they did. They want to make amends."

Sarah stood up. "Then let's get started."

## The Allies

---

They met in a hideout in the Rocky Mountains. Remote. Inaccessible. Perfect.

There were ten people. From different countries. Different backgrounds. But all with the same goal: bringing the truth to light.

"You know what's at stake," Sarah said. "If we fail, we'll die. Or worse."

One of the men nodded. "We understand."

"Then let's begin."

## The Attack

---

It was midnight when they struck.

The Architects' headquarters was a high-rise in Geneva. Glass and steel. A symbol of power.

Sarah and her team broke in. Quiet. Fast. Deadly.

There were fights. Injuries. Even deaths.

But in the end, they stood triumphant.

The Architects had fallen.

# CHAPTER 43

## The Peace

---

One year later.

Sarah sat by the window of her house in Vermont. Spring had come. The flowers were blooming.

Her phone rang. A message from Lily.

"Mom, I'm pregnant."

Sarah smiled. Tears ran down her face.

A new life. A new hope.

The past was past. The future? The future was open.
