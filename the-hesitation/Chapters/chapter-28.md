# CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

## The Chen Clarity

---

One year later.

Sarah stood in front of a room full of FBI trainees. Younger than she had been. Hungry. Ready.

"Most of you have heard of the Chen Calm," she said. "The myth. The legend."

The students nodded.

"Forget it." Sarah smiled. "The Chen Calm is a lie. What you need is the Chen Clarity."

She walked through the rows of desks.

"Know when to act. Know when to feel. And know the difference."

A hand went up. "How do we know?"

"You don't." Sarah laughed. "That's the secret. You never know for certain. All you can do is trust yourself. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard."

She thought of Lily. Of James. Of Elena.

Of the hesitation that had haunted her for fifteen years.

"The hesitation isn't your enemy," she said. "It's your guide. Listen to it. Learn from it. But never let it stop you from making a choice."

The students wrote notes. Absorbed her words.

Sarah looked at them—this new generation of negotiators—and smiled.

The circle was complete.
