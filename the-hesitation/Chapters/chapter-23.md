# CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE

## The Showdown

---

The gunshot shattered the silence.

James fell, his shoulder torn open. Marcus stood in the doorway, gun still smoking.

"Disappointing," Marcus said coldly. "I expected more from you, James."

"You—" James gasped for air. "You used me—"

"I built you." Marcus turned to Sarah. "And now, Dr. Chen. Your daughter for your silence. A fair trade, don't you think?"

"No."

Marcus laughed. "You don't have a choice."

Sarah moved. One swift motion, and she had Lily's chair turned, the rope binding her wrists exposed. She pulled out the hidden blade Lily had been working on for days.

Lily was free.

"Go!" Sarah shouted.

But Lily didn't run. Instead, she grabbed James's gun from the floor and pointed it at Marcus.

"Drop it," she said, her voice steady.

Marcus hesitated. For the first time, he looked uncertain.

"You don't have the guts, girl."

"Maybe not." Lily smiled. "But I have something better. A teacher."

And then Sarah spoke. Not as a negotiator. As a mother. As a human being.

"Marcus. It's over. Elena is alive. She's going to testify. The network is finished."

"No."

"Yes. And when you go down, it's going to be for everything. The Harrison case. The frame. The trafficking. All of it."

Marcus's face twisted. "You don't know anything."

"I know you orchestrated everything. I know you destroyed James to protect yourself. And I know—" Sarah paused. "I know I should have trusted my instincts fifteen years ago."

Something shifted in Marcus's expression. For a moment, he looked almost... afraid.

And then David appeared in the doorway, flanked by federal agents.

"It's over, Marcus."
