# CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO

## The Aftermath

---

The flash drive contained more than Sarah had expected. Names of corrupt officials. Evidence of cover-ups. Proof of a conspiracy that went all the way to the top.

But it also contained something else: a warning.

The Architects knew she was coming. They had known since the moment James had handed her the drive. The entire meeting at Pier 39 had been a test—a way of measuring her response, gauging her next move.

And now they were ready.

---

The first attempt on her life came three days after the meeting.

She was walking to her car in a parking garage when she heard the click. A silenced shot, barely audible over the hum of the fluorescent lights. The bullet missed her by inches, chipping the concrete wall beside her head.

She dropped, rolled, came up with her weapon drawn. But there was no one there. Just the echo of footsteps fading into the distance.

She called David.

"They know," she said. "They've made their move."

---

The next three months were a blur of activity.

Sarah worked with federal investigators—some she trusted, others she watched carefully. She testified before congressional committees, exposing the corruption piece by piece. She coordinated with journalists who were willing to listen, to investigate, to publish the truth.

And slowly, the tide began to turn.

A senator was arrested. Then a judge. Then a former FBI director. Each arrest sent shockwaves through the system, each revelation peeled back another layer of the conspiracy.

By the time the three months were over, the FBI had a new director—someone clean, someone honest, someone who would actually do the job they were supposed to do. Congress had launched twelve investigations. And Sarah Chen had become a household name again—but for different reasons.

She was no longer the famous negotiator. She was the woman who had exposed the truth.

---

She retired from the FBI on a rainy Tuesday in November.

It felt strange to walk away—from the job, from the mission, from the identity she had built over decades. But it also felt right. The fight was over. The truth was out. And now it was time for someone else to carry the torch.

Lily was waiting for her outside headquarters, holding a bouquet of flowers.

"Congratulations, Mom."

Sarah took the flowers. They were yellow—her favorite. "What for?"

"For finally doing the right thing." Lily smiled. "Not for the right reasons. But still."

Sarah laughed. It felt strange on her face. Unfamiliar. "When did you get so wise?"

"When I spent three months being kidnapped by a crazy man." Lily shrugged. "You learn a lot about perspective."

They walked down the steps together, into the rain, into the unknown.

"What now?" Lily asked.

Sarah looked at the grey sky, the grey city, the grey future ahead. For the first time in fifteen years, she felt free. The weight was gone—the guilt, the doubt, the endless questioning. She had done what she set out to do. She had found the truth. She had made it right.

Now it was time to discover who she was without the mission.

"Now?" She smiled. "Now we find out who we really are."
