# CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE

## The Meeting

---

Pier 39 was abandoned now. The tourist shops had closed five years ago, leaving only rust and memories.

Sarah arrived at 9:45. Early. Always early.

The warehouse stood at the end of the pier, a skeletal reminder of San Francisco's industrial past. She approached carefully, her training taking over.

No guards. No weapons. Just an old man sitting on a crate, staring at the bay.

James.

He looked different. Thinner. Older. His hair had gone grey at the temples. But his eyes—his eyes were the same. Haunted. Brilliant. Lost.

"You came," he said without turning.

"You asked me to."

"I wasn't sure you would." He finally looked at her. "After everything."

"Tell me about the network."

James laughed bitterly. "The network. Always the network." He shook his head. "It's not what you think, Sarah. It's not about money or power. It's about control. About changing the system from within."

"You're talking about terrorism."

"I'm talking about revolution." He stood, walked to the water's edge. "The FBI is corrupt. The government is corrupt. Marcus saw it. I saw it. We wanted to change it."

"By kidnapping my daughter? By framing innocent people?"

"By any means necessary." He turned to face her. "I know you don't understand. You never did. That's why you were never part of it."

Sarah stepped forward. "Then let me understand now. Help me see what you saw."

James hesitated. For a moment, she saw the student she'd trained. The brilliant young man who'd wanted to save the world.

"It's too late," he said. "For me, at least. But for you—maybe not. Maybe you can finish what we started."

"How?"

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a flash drive.

"Everything. Names, locations, operations. It's all here." He held it out. "Take it. Use it. Make it right."

Sarah took the drive. "James—"

"Don't." His voice broke. "Don't say my name like you care. You never did. None of you did."

He walked away.
