# CHAPTER THIRTY

## Shadows of the Past

---

The call came at 3 AM.

Sarah groggily reached for her phone. Unknown number. California.

"Hello?"

"Dr. Chen." The voice was familiar. Haunted. "It's James."

She sat up, suddenly awake. "James? How did you get this number?"

"It doesn't matter." He sounded different. Calmer. Empty. "I need to tell you something. Before it's too late."

"Too late for what?"

"The network. Marcus wasn't alone. There are others. People he trained. People who are still out there."

Sarah's blood ran cold. "Who? Give me names."

"I can't. Not over the phone." A pause. "Meet me. Tomorrow. The old warehouse at Pier 39. 10 AM. Come alone."

"James—"

"Please, Sarah. This is the only way I can make it right."

The line went dead.
