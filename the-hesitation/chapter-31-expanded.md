# CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE

## The First Crack

---

The third week brought the first breakthrough.

Sarah had been working through the files methodically, tracking connections, building a case that would stand up in court. It was slow, painstaking work—the kind of work that required patience and precision.

And then she found it.

A name that appeared in multiple files, connected to multiple operations, hidden behind multiple layers of corporate shell companies. A name that, once she traced it back, led to a person she knew.

James's former handler. The man who had been assigned to him after Sarah's training, the one who had guided him into Marcus's network. The one who had turned a brilliant young negotiator into a weapon.

His name was Robert Chen.

No relation—Sarah had checked. But the coincidence was unsettling.

She called David.

"I need you to run a background," she said. "Robert Chen. Former FBI, now private security. I want to know everything—where he lives, who he works for, what he's been doing for the last fifteen years."

"That's going to take some time."

"I don't have time." Sarah's voice was hard. "Every day this goes on, more people get hurt. More families get destroyed. I need answers now."

David called back two hours later.

"Robert Chen works for a company called Sentinel Group," he said. "Private military, mostly. They do contract work for the government—overseas operations, black-site missions, that kind of thing."

"Connections to the Architects?"

"Indirect. But there's something else." David paused. "He has a daughter. She's in college. UCLA. Her name is—"

"Chen?" Sarah's heart sank. "Sarah Chen?"

"No. Emma. Emma Chen."

Sarah let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. "Okay. That's something."

"What's the plan?"

Sarah looked at the files spread across her desk. The names, the dates, the evidence. It was overwhelming—but it was also beginning to make sense.

"I'm going to meet with him," she said. "Face to face. No wires, no backup. Just conversation."

"That's insane."

"Probably." Sarah smiled grimly. "But it's the only way I'm going to get him to talk. Men like Robert Chen—they don't trust the system. They don't trust the government. But they do trust themselves. And if I can get him to see me as a person—not a threat, not an adversary—maybe I can get through."

The meeting was set for a diner in Virginia, halfway between Quantico and the city.

Robert Chen was older than Sarah had expected—sixty, maybe, with grey hair and a paunch that suggested he'd let himself go. But his eyes were sharp, calculating, missing nothing.

"Dr. Chen." He didn't offer to shake hands. "I wondered when you'd come."

"You know why I'm here."

"I know what you think you know." He sat down across from her, uninvited. "But you don't understand the full picture."

"Then explain it to me."

Chen laughed. It was a hollow sound. "You want me to betray my people? My friends? The men and women who've given everything to protect this country?"

"I want you to tell the truth."

"The truth?" His voice hardened. "The truth is that the system is broken. The truth is that elected officials are corrupt, that the media is biased, that the American people are being fed lies every single day. The Architects—those are the people actually trying to make a difference."

"By kidnapping children? By destroying families? By creating weapons like James Morrison?"

"By any means necessary." Chen's eyes met hers, unblinking. "You taught James to hesitate. We taught him to act. Together, we created something extraordinary."

"You created a monster."

"We created a solution." Chen stood, dropping a twenty on the table for his untouched coffee. "You're not going to stop us, Dr. Chen. No one can. We're too big, too deep, too connected. The best advice I can give you is to walk away. Forget what you know. Focus on your daughter, your career, your life. Let us do what we have to do."

He walked out of the diner.

Sarah sat alone, the twenty-dollar bill still on the table, the weight of his words pressing down on her.
