# CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN

## The Reckoning

---

Six months later.

The courtroom was silent as Marcus Webb was led away in chains. The trial had lasted three weeks. The verdict took the jury four hours.

Guilty on all counts.

But Sarah wasn't thinking about Marcus. She was thinking about James.

James Morrison, who had been found in a cabin in Montana, half-starved, delirious after being shot and left for dead by Marcus when his usefulness had ended. Who had spent four months in a psychiatric facility, refusing to see anyone, refusing to speak, refusing to acknowledge that any of it had happened.

He was free now. Not healed, not redeemed. Just free.

The doctors said it would take years—if ever—for him to recover fully. The trauma was too deep, the scars too vast. But he was alive. He was trying. And that, Sarah had learned, was sometimes enough.

"Sarah."

She turned. David stood behind her, Lily at his side. Their faces were tired but hopeful—the exhaustion of the trial, the relief of its conclusion.

"Let's go," David said. "It's over."

"Is it?" Sarah looked back at the empty courtroom, at the judge's bench, at the defendant's chair where Marcus had sat for weeks, his mask finally cracked, his defenses finally broken. "Is it really?"

Lily took her mother's hand. "It's over, Mom. It's time to let go."

Sarah nodded. But the hesitation in her heart remained—the question that would never be answered, the doubt that would never fully fade.

*What if I had seen it sooner?*

The days after the trial were a blur of interviews, debriefings, and media appearances. Sarah spoke to journalists, to FBI officials, to congressional committees. She told the story—her story, James's story, Lily's story—over and over again, each time feeling a little lighter, a little more free.

But at night, alone in her hotel room, she still struggled.

The nightmares came almost every evening. She dreamed of James, as he had been fifteen years ago—young, eager, desperate to prove himself. She dreamed of the hesitation, the pattern, the missed signs. She dreamed of Lily in that cabin, bound and afraid, calling out for help that seemed impossible to provide.

She woke in a sweat, heart pounding, the images fading but never quite disappearing.

And she wondered: would it ever really be over?

---

Three weeks after the trial, Sarah received a letter.

It was handwritten, on plain paper, with no return address. Just a single sentence:

*Thank you for telling the truth.*

She didn't know who sent it. She suspected James—though he had never confirmed, never visited, never reached out in any way. But it didn't matter. The message was clear.

*The truth matters. And now, it's out.*

Sarah folded the letter carefully and placed it in a drawer. Not to forget, but to remember. To remind herself that even in the darkest moments, there was always a path toward light.
